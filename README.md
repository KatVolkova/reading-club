## Design

### Colour Scheme

Colours used:

* I have used `#f5f5f5` & `#000000` as the primary and secondary colours used for the sites text.
* I have used `#292929` as the overlay used over the sites background image.


  

### Typography

Google Fonts was used to import the chosen fonts for use in the site.

* For the Page Title I have used the google font [Almendra](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Almendra?preview.text=The%20Quiz%20Arms%20THE%20QUIZ%20ARMS&preview.text_type=custom&query=almendra).

![Almendra Font Example](documentation/almendra.webp)

* For the body of the page I have used the google font [Quicksand](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Quicksand?preview.text=The%20Quiz%20Arms%20THE%20QUIZ%20ARMS&preview.text_type=custom&query=quicksand).

### Imagery

#### Future Implementations

In future implementations I would like to:

1. Give users the option to select the amount of questions in their quiz.
2. Look into making the quiz a multiplayer game, so that it could be played by teams, which would make the quiz even more like a pub quiz.
3. Create a back end database to enable me to store scores which would then allow you to see how you scored against other players.
4. Look further into the accessibility for people with colour blindness, perhaps by adding symbols such as a tick or cross next to the answer when they are checked.
