## Testing

Validator testing was carried out using the following:

- HTML files of all four pages do not contain either errors or warnings according to the official [W3C validator](https://validator.w3.org)
- CSS file does not contain either errors or warnings according to the official [Jigsaw validator](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/)
  
### Solved Bugs

- The error identified in the middle of the project is the use of a combination of a button and a link element, as the button element cannot be a child decendent of a link and vice versa. This error has been fixed by leaving the link only and styling it as a button using CSS.
	 
- Join Us button had the same colour applied for both the background and the border properties. This error has been fixed by removing the border colour.
	 
- Spelling mistake for align-items attribute value:center has been corrected.

- Trailing slashes have been removed from meta elements.
